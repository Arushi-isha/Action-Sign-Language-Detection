# Action-Sign-Language-Detction
This project is a real-time Sign Language Detection System that uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures representing the actions. The aim is to aid communication for the hearing and speech impaired by detecting sign gestures through a webcam.

# Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam.

- Predicts action sign language using an LSTM NN built on TF Keras.

- Uses OpenCV for live video feed processing.

- Easy to train with your own dataset for better accuracy.
